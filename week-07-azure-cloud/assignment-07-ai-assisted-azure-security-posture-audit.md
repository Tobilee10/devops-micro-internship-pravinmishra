# Assignment 7 — AI-Assisted Azure Security Posture Audit

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build a read-only Bash script that audits the Azure resources you deployed earlier this week — a virtual machine, a three-tier network with a Load Balancer, a Storage Account, and an Azure Database for MySQL server — for common security misconfigurations. You will connect that script to Claude Code as a reusable `/azure-audit` skill that explains findings and recommends a fix without ever running it, then fix one real finding yourself and prove the fix with a second audit run. This is the same read-only-evidence-then-human-fixes discipline from Week 3, now applied to Azure with the `az` CLI instead of Linux commands — and the cloud-agnostic counterpart to the AWS audit you built in Week 6.

---

# Task 1 — Confirm Your Resources and Create the Workspace

## Goal

Confirm your Azure CLI is authenticated and can see the VM, network, storage account, and MySQL server you built this week, then set up a workspace folder for the audit.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — `az account show` and `az vm list -d -o table` confirming your subscription and running VM (subscription ID partially blurred)

---

# Task 2 — Create Project Context and Safety Rules in CLAUDE.md

## Goal

Create a `CLAUDE.md` for this workspace that tells Claude what the audit covers and the safety rules it must follow: never run a mutating `az` command, never claim a finding without report evidence, and always let the human review and run any remediation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `CLAUDE.md` open in your editor showing the project overview, audit workflow, and safety rules

# Task 3 — Use Agentic AI to Plan the Audit Before Writing the Script

## Goal

Ask Claude Code to read `CLAUDE.md` and propose a read-only, four-check audit plan (NSG rules open to `0.0.0.0/0` on port 22 or 3389, storage account public blob access, VM disk encryption status, and Azure Database for MySQL public network access) — without creating or editing any file yet.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Claude Code showing the four-check plan, with no files created or modified

---

# Task 4 — Build the Azure Audit Bash Script

## Goal

Write a Bash script that runs the four checks from Task 3 using read-only `az` commands, writes a PASS/WARN/FAIL report with your Full Name, and exits with a different code for a healthy, warning, or failing result. Validate it with `bash -n` and make it executable.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Your script open in your editor, showing the check functions and the `az` commands they call

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Output of `bash -n` (no syntax errors) and `ls -l` showing the script is executable

---

# Task 5 — Run the Script and Review the Baseline Report

## Goal

Run the script against your live resources and read the report honestly, even if it shows a real finding — do not fix anything yet.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Script output showing your Full Name and all four checks with a PASS, WARN, or FAIL result

![screenshot](./screenshots/ass7-screen6.png)

---

# Task 6 — Create and Run the /azure-audit Skill

## Goal

Create a Claude Code skill restricted to read-only tools (no `Write`) that runs your script, reads the report, and explains every finding with the risk of leaving it unresolved — without ever running a remediation command itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Your skill file's frontmatter showing `allowed-tools` without `Write`

---

#### Screenshot 8 — `/azure-audit` output showing the baseline findings and Claude's explanation

---

# Task 7 — Fix a Real Finding and Re-Verify

## Goal

Pick one WARN or FAIL finding (or deliberately open an NSG rule to port 22 from `0.0.0.0/0` if your baseline was already clean), save that failing report, run the remediation command yourself — scoped to your own IP, not left open — and confirm the second audit run shows it resolved.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Saved report showing the original finding before the fix

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Terminal output of the remediation command you ran yourself

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Second `/azure-audit` run (or report) showing the finding resolved

### Notes

Compare this assignment to the AWS audit you built in Week 6: which finding categories map to each other across the two clouds, and what stayed exactly the same about the workflow even though the `az`/`aws` commands are completely different?

The Azure assignment and the Week 6 AWS audit have many of the same finding categories, such as public access, excessive permissions, open network ports, missing encryption, and weak logging.
The main difference is that Azure uses az commands and Azure resources, while AWS uses aws commands and AWS resources.
However, the overall audit workflow stayed the same across both clouds.
We first discovered resources, checked their security configurations, and compared them against security best practices.
Then we documented the findings, assigned risk, recommended remediation, and verified the fixes.
So, although the commands differ, the security assessment methodology remains essentially identical.
