# Assignment 6 — Capstone Assignment — Deploy Book Review App (Three-Tier Architecture) on AWS

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

This is the most important assignment of the course. You will deploy the Book Review App in a fully production-style three-tier architecture on AWS: a Next.js Web Tier behind Nginx and a public ALB, a private Node.js/Express App Tier behind an internal ALB, and a private Multi-AZ MySQL RDS database with a read replica. You are expected to design, deploy, isolate, debug, and document the result independently.

---

# Task 1 — Architecture Diagram

## Goal

Create an architecture diagram showing the custom VPC (10.0.0.0/16), the six subnets across two Availability Zones (two public Web Tier, two private App Tier, two private Database Tier), the public ALB, Web Tier EC2/Nginx, internal ALB, private App Tier EC2, private Multi-AZ RDS with its read replica, and the permitted traffic flow.

# Task 2 — AWS Region & Services Used

## Goal

Record the AWS Region used and list every AWS service used across networking, compute, load balancing, security, and the database.

### Notes

**Region:**

US-EAST-2

---

**Services:**

- EC2
- LOAD BALANCER
- VPC
- RDS 
- SECURITY GROUPS
- ELASTIC IP    
- NAT GATEWAY 

---

# Task 3 — Public Entry Point

## Goal

Confirm the Book Review App loads through the public ALB DNS name.

### Evidence

#### Public ALB DNS

Paste your public ALB DNS name here:

`http://book-review-web-alb-1360914206.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com`

---

# Task 4 — Evidence Screenshots

## Goal

Capture visual proof of every tier and load balancer.

# Task 5 — Summary

## Goal

Summarize what worked in the final deployment, the issues encountered and how each was fixed, and the tools or sources used to research and debug.

### Notes

**What worked:**

The application, database, and supporting infrastructure were successfully configured and deployed.

---

**Issues + fixes:**

One issue encountered was being unable to SSH into the EC2 instance because the security group was restricted to my IP address. The issue was caused by my IP address changing, so the existing security-group rule no longer matched my current connection. I fixed it by updating the security-group SSH rule to allow my current IP address. The issue was diagnosed and resolved through the AWS Management Console.

---

**Tools/sources used:**

AWS Management Console for implementation, Claude for guidance and troubleshooting, and AWS documentation for researching configurations and resolving issues.

# LinkedIn Post (Required)

## Goal

Publish a LinkedIn post sharing the capstone deployment, including the public ALB DNS (or a redacted screenshot), three to five lines on what you built and why it is production-style, and one proof screenshot.

## Evidence

#### LinkedIn Post URL

Paste your LinkedIn post URL here:

`https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oluwatobiloba-adeje-2572b42a6_devops-aws-cloudengineering-activity-7495483328184143873-nzS6?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAEm6D2MBiHlTtqXxAdNL2_2Taiskof8w_Lw`
