# Assignment 6 — Safety Rails for Your AI Agent

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will configure safety and control mechanisms for Claude Code using permissions and hooks. You will define team-level command restrictions and implement prompt-level and tool-level hooks to prevent destructive actions before they execute.

---

# Task 1 — Create settings.json with Permissions

## Goal

Create a team-level `settings.json` file with allow and deny rules for safe command execution.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — settings.json permissions configuration

# Task 2 — Add the UserPromptSubmit Hook

## Goal

Add a hook that intercepts user prompts before Claude starts execution and blocks destructive intent.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — settings.json showing UserPromptSubmit hook

# Task 3 — Add the PreToolUse Hook

## Goal

Extend `settings.json` with a PreToolUse hook that blocks dangerous Bash commands before execution.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — full settings.json with permissions and hooks

# Task 4 — Test the UserPromptSubmit Hook

## Goal

Verify that destructive prompts are blocked before Claude begins execution.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — blocked prompt due to UserPromptSubmit hook

# Task 5 — Test the PreToolUse Hook

## Goal

Verify that dangerous commands are intercepted before execution by the PreToolUse hook.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — PreToolUse hook blocking terraform destroy
